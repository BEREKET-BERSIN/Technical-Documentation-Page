                <p>Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van
                    Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its
                    notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to
                    help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.</p>
                <p>Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms,
                    including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is often described as a
                    "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.</p>
                <p>Python was conceived in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC language. Python 2.0, released in
                    2000, introduced features like list comprehensions and a garbage collection system capable of
                    collecting reference cycles. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision of the language that
                    is not completely backward-compatible, and much Python 2 code does not run unmodified on Python 3.
                </p>
                <p>The Python 2 language, i.e. Python 2.7.x, was officially discontinued on 1 January 2020 (first
                    planned for 2015) after which security patches and other improvements will not be released for it.
                    With Python 2's end-of-life, only Python 3.5.x and later are supported.</p>
                <p>Python interpreters are available for many operating systems. A global community of programmers
                    develops and maintains CPython, an open source reference implementation. A non-profit organization,
                    the Python Software Foundation, manages and directs resources for Python and CPython development.

            <article>
                <p>Python uses whitespace indentation, rather than curly brackets or keywords, to delimit blocks. An
                    increase in indentation comes after certain statements; a decrease in indentation signifies the end
                    of the current block.Thus, the program's visual structure accurately represents the program's
                    semantic structure. This feature is sometimes termed the off-side rule, which some other languages
                    share, but in most languages indentation doesn't have any semantic meaning.</p>

            </header>
            <article>
                <p>Python's statements include (among others):</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>The assignment statement (token '=', the equals sign). This operates differently than in
                            traditional imperative programming languages, and this fundamental mechanism (including the
                            nature of Python's version of variables) illuminates many other features of the language.
                            Assignment in C, e.g., x = 2, translates to "typed variable name x receives a copy of
                            numeric value 2". The (right-hand) value is copied into an allocated storage location for
                            which the (left-hand) variable name is the symbolic address. The memory allocated to the
                            variable is large enough (potentially quite large) for the declared type. In the simplest
                            case of Python assignment, using the same example, x = 2, translates to "(generic) name x
                            receives a reference to a separate, dynamically allocated object of numeric (int) type of
                            value 2." This is termed binding the name to the object. Since the name's storage location
                            doesn't contain the indicated value, it is improper to call it a variable. Names may be
                            subsequently rebound at any time to objects of greatly varying types, including strings,
                            procedures, complex objects with data and methods, etc. Successive assignments of a common
                            value to multiple names, e.g., x = 2; y = 2; z = 2 result in allocating storage to (at most)
                            three names and one numeric object, to which all three names are bound. Since a name is a
                            generic reference holder it is unreasonable to associate a fixed data type with it. However
                            at a given time a name will be bound to some object, which will have a type; thus there is
                            dynamic typing.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>The if statement, which conditionally executes a block of code, along with else and elif (a
                            contraction of else-if).</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>The for statement, which iterates over an iterable object, capturing each element to a local
                            variable for use by the attached block.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>

                    <li>
                        <p>The try statement, which allows exceptions raised in its attached code block to be caught and
                            handled by except clauses; it also ensures that clean-up code in a finally block will always
                            be run regardless of how the block exits.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>The class statement, which executes a block of code and attaches its local namespace to a
                            class, for use in object-oriented programming.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>The def statement, which defines a function or method.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>The break statement, exits from the loop.</p>

                <p>Python's large standard library, commonly cited as one of its greatest strengths, provides tools
                    suited to many tasks. For Internet-facing applications, many standard formats and protocols such as
                    MIME and HTTP are supported. It includes modules for creating graphical user interfaces, connecting
                    to relational databases, generating pseudorandom numbers, arithmetic with arbitrary-precision
                    decimals, manipulating regular expressions, and unit testing.</p>
                <p>Some parts of the standard library are covered by specifications (for example, the Web Server Gateway
                    Interface (WSGI) implementation wsgiref follows PEP 333), but most modules are not. They are
                    specified by their code, internal documentation, and test suites (if supplied). However, because
                    most of the standard library is cross-platform Python code, only a few modules need altering or
                    rewriting for variant implementations.</p>
                <p>As of November 2019, the Python Package Index (PyPI), the official repository for third-party Python
                    software, contains over 200,000 packages with a wide range of functionality, including:</p>
